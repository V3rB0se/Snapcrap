# What Is Snapcrap?
<br>
<img src="https://ImageHostx.github.io/sc.png">
<br>
   <b></b> Snapcrap is a console application I made to make it easier to extract snapchat's data (snaps and shit) stored in the data folder of snapchat
     using windows.<br>
     before using this program download and install this snapchat version <a href="https://mega.nz/file/HUZ2zLiZ#3DD8rAGq33ZhViuenTs7aqip6CChlyao6V2ziBjWE84">Snapchat v11</a>
     
  
# How it works? <br>
   <b></b> it just extract the data stored in the data folder of snapchat to sdcard and change the extension to their respective file format using file headers. it works over android debugging bridge (adb).
    <br>


# Requirements? <br>
    1. Rooted Android Phone.
    2. Snapchat Installed (Well?)
    3. Brain (Optional :P)
    
# Extraction
   <br>
   1. Compile it using Visual Studio Code 2019 or 2022 OR Download a precompiled Executable <a href="https://github.com/V3rB0se/Snapcrap/releases/download/v1/Program.zip">from here </a><br>
   2. Turn on The Developer Options by tapping on build number 7 times <br>
   3. Turn on Usb Debugging from settings <br>
   4. Connect your Android Device to windows machine <br>
   4.5 Download and Install <a href="https://mega.nz/file/HUZ2zLiZ#3DD8rAGq33ZhViuenTs7aqip6CChlyao6V2ziBjWE84">Snapchat v11</a> Login to Snapchat & open/play all the snaps saved in chat to load them.
   5. Run the program and press Y you'll get an error (do not close the program) disconnect the phone from your pc and connect again . <br> You'll get a prompt confirming usb debugging operation permission, allow it <br>
   6. Run the program again. When it finishes, you will find the result on your phone in a folder named snapchat_exports.
   <br>
   You have to run this program twice its a bug, trying to figure out a solution.
