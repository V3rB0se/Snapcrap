# Q. What Is Snapcrap?
<br>
   <b>A.</b> Snapcrap is a console application i made to make it easier to extract snapchat's data (snaps and shit) stored in the data folder of snapchat
     using windows operating system.
  
# Q. Why? 
<br>
   <b>A.</b> <b> seriously? this question? anyway it was because i fell for someone (jk) </b>. 
   <br> I was searching for a way to extract the (snaps saved in the chat) without notifying my friends. after spending hours of browsing and searching through the
     internet i found a gist which claims to extract the data from snapchat. The gist is created by <a href="https://github.com/programminghoch10">programminghoch10</a>
     it's a shell script. the downside of his script is you have to type a bunch of lines in terminal to get it to work. The real reason of this project is to make it 
     easier to extract the data without typing those "bunch of lines".  so i took his idea after asking him nicely. and started working on the project.
  
# Q. How it works? <br>
   <b>A.</b> it just extract the data stored in the data folder of snapchat to sdcard and change the extension to their respective file format using file headers. it works over android debugging bridge (adb).
    <br>


# Q. Requirements? <br>
    1. Rooted Android Phone (Obviously xD).
    2. Snapchat Installed (Well?).
    3. Bunch of Girlfriends (Obviously jk lol).
    4. Brain (Mandatory :P)
    
# Q. Extraction
   <br>
   
   1. Compile it using Visual Studio Code 2019 or 2022 OR Download a precompiled Executable <a href="#">from here </a><br>
   2. Turn on The Developer Options by tapping on build number 7 times <br>
   3. Turn on Usb Debugging from settings <br>
   4. Connect your Android Device to windows machine <br>
   5. Run the program and press Y you'll get an error (do not close the program) disconnect the phone from your pc and connect again . <br> You'll get a prompt confirming usb debugging operation permission, allow it <br>
   6. Run the program again. When it finishes, you will find the result on your phone in a folder named snapchat_exports.
   <br>
   You have to run this program 2 times its a bug. I'm still trying to figure out a solution.
